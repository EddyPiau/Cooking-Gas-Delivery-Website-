# Cooking-Gas-Delivery-Website-
**Project Overview**

This business provides cooking gas delivery to the customers. It has six main brands of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) which are Petronas, Mira, Petron, Petros, BHP Petrol and Solar Gas. Across the nation, thousands of dealers and distributors are already operating in the same business. However, they are not evenly distributed across different areas, leading to a shortage of gas delivery services in some areas. In response, Hawra Trading took the initiative to take this opportunity. 
Hawra Trading’s business model is by offering a convenient and safe way to get LPG delivered right to customers’ home or business, saving their time and hassle. Hawra Trading can keep the gas supply easy and accessible. The pricing is straightforward by paying for each cylinder delivered, with a small delivery fee. Hawra Trading also offer subscription plans for regular deliveries, which come with loyalty discounts. Extra help with setup, cleaning or a safety check are also provided by adding fee.


Hawra Trading system was developed for everyone who wants to purchase the Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) so that they can save their time and energy. It offers a lot of services such as delivery, installation and maintenance of LPG. Other than that, for another user types, it allows the user to create, read, update and delete the actions required for the stock of the product, services and prices. However, it will require the users to have access to a web browser on their devices which means that the users of the system do not need to invest other software. The system will also have the ability to view transaction details, make payment and generate transaction report to send to their transaction system. This feature is built into the MySQL and do not need any other software to function. The user can also send email notifications to the other user types.
